# albumList
A simple JS app where users can enter any music album through an input form and add it to the album table right below the form. Each album gets saved through localStorage and the user can also delete albums already on the table. Each album must have its own unique album ID. If the user puts in an album ID that already exists, the app should notify the user to change to a different album ID.
